# Reflector Connector for .NET

This project is an attempt at building a MirrorLink client that can be deployed to mobile devices for folks that have older vehicles, 
especiaily those without newer technologies like Apple Carplay or Android Auto, but has MirrorLink as an option.

This document will serve as a running log of changes.  The goal is to port the Car Connectivity samples into a working application
using Microsoft .NET
